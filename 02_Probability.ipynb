    "### Experiment    \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment is simply the test we want to perform. We perform the test because we’re interested in the probability of each possible outcome. Rolling a die, flipping a coin, and pulling a card from a deck of cards are all examples of experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single run of an exper-iment is referred to as a **trial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "All possible outcomes of an experiment form a set known as the sample space, which we’ll usually call $S$ in our formulas. For example, when a six-sided die is rolled once, the sample space is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Event \n",
    "An event is a set of outcomes that we want to calculate the prob-ability of and that form a subset of the sample space. For example, we might want to know the probability of a particular outcome, like rolling a 3, or the probability of a set of multiple outcomes, such as rolling an even number (either 2, 4, or 6). We’ll use the letter E in our formulas to stand for an event.\n",

    "### Uniform distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "If each outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur, we say the outcomes come from the **uniform distribution** (we'll see other distributions later on).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the probability of an event, $P(E)$, occurring is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(E) = \\dfrac{|E|}{|S|}$$\n",

    "Remember that $|x|$ is the *cardinality* of a set $x$ in math, which is equivalent to `len(x)` in python.\n",
